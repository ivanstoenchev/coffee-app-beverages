                <h1>Our Coffee Story</h1>
                <h3>Robusta - Arabica Coffee Blends</h3>
                <p>The two varieties differ in taste, growing conditions, bean size and price. Coffee Purists favour
                    Arabica. Quality and price are rated much higher. But there are many that prefer the blended
                    Arabica/Robusta with a ratio of 80/20 which seems to be the most popular. Arabica beans tend to have
                    a sweeter, softer taste, with tones of sugar, fruit and berries. Robusta, however, has a stronger,
                    harsher taste, with a grain-like overtone and peanut aroma. We have something for every taste.</p>

                <h3>The origins of Arabica and Robusta</h3>
                <p>The origin of coffee is lost in time and legend. There are so many stories about the discovery and
                    origin of coffee that one day you would lose yourself listening to them all.

                    What is important is that everyone, in their own way, claims the invention of the drink. Muslims
                    even narrate that the coffee was given to Mohammed by Allah himself, through his messenger the
                    Archangel Gabriel, to keep him in strength in a difficult moment.

                    In any case, what is known almost for certain is that the quality of Arabica probably originated in
                    Ethiopia and only spread in Europe after a long time.

                    We are in 1600 when solid evidence of this drink coming from the East begins to arrive, from here
                    the diffusion becomes exponential.

                    Coffea Canephora, better known as Robusta, appeared later. Less valuable, but extremely resistant,
                    it probably originated from Congo and became particularly appreciated because of its versatility,
                    its low cost and its energy richness.</p>
